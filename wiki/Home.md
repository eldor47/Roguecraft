## What is Roguecraft?

Roguecraft is a Minecraft plugin that transforms your server into a roguelike experience. Players enter corrupted rifts (Arena Realms) where they fight escalating swarms of mobs, collect XP shards, level up, and choose from randomized power-ups.

### Key Features

- **Arena Realm System** - Enter rifts and fight in isolated arenas
- **Dynamic Leveling** - Gain XP and level up with power-up choices
- **Difficulty Scaling** - Automatically scales with time and wave number
- **Power-Up System** - Collect and combine powerful upgrades
- **Multiplayer Support** - Play solo or with friends
- **Fully Configurable** - Customize everything via YAML files

## Story

The world is glitching. Chunks "de-render" into a monochrome Arena Realm where mobs spawn from corrupted rifts. Players slip into the Realm during nightly rifts, fight escalating swarms, and return at dawn—if they survive.

**Goal:** Close rifts by surviving a timed "night" (e.g., 15 minutes) or defeating the Realm Boss. Each successful night strengthens the next rift.

## Getting Started

1. **Install** the plugin (see [Installation](Installation.md))
2. **Configure** an arena (see [Configuration](Configuration.md))
3. **Start** a run with `/rc start`
4. **Fight** mobs and collect XP
5. **Level up** and choose power-ups
6. **Survive** as long as possible!
